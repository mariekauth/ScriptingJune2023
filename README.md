# ScriptingJune2023
Learn JavaScript and how the tests relate

## Purpose
JavaScript is a loosely typed scripting language traditionally used for writing client side code. (Code that runs in a clients browser).
- It can now run both client side, and server-side.
- It is used by both developers and QA/QE engineers.
- Since it can be run client side, without a server, it is a also a good environment for new engineers (developers and quality engineers alike) to learn many advanced programming concepts.

This project will be used to share projects to introduce additional concepts, provide projects for training.

## What this is NOT
This will not teach you the basics for JavaScript. Instead it is supplemental material for other official JavaScript courses, to help apply the knowledge learned.

## Other resources courses
- [Why testers should learn JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBQIrqTyT3I)
- [Learn online (test cases already written)](https://learnjavascript.online/)
- [If struggling with one above](https://learnprogramming.online/?utm_source=learnjavascript.online)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) is a site I used years ago, I feel there are now others that do a much better job of explaining the basics, but I sometimes still come here for reference. I think they still explain the history. I have seen many sites come and go, but this one has been fairly consistent over the years.
- [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) has many tutorials. Maximilian Schwarzmuller often has some great tutorials.
- [MS Learn - Web Development for Beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/web-development-101/), MS Learn has free tutorials on a lot of different topics.
